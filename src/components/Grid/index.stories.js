        <h3>Brain plasticity problems</h3>
        <p>
          The problem with cramming is that you don't learn, not really. You might pass the test, but a few days later, everything you've worked so hard to put in your brain has somehow fallen out. Luckily, microlearning has his own sidekick - <strong>spaced repetition</strong>. Microlearning allows learners to be re-presented with content at spaced intervals, so they can revise and cement their knowledge, leading to mastery over time. Bam. Pow. Mastery here we come.
